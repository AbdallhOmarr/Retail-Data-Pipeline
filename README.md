# Retail Data Pipeline Project

This repository contains a data pipeline project I completed on DataCamp, demonstrating my skills in data engineering and data analysis for retail data.

## Project Overview

This project involves building a pipeline to process, clean, and transform raw retail data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Engineering**: Creating efficient data pipelines.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and filtering data using Python and pandas.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting useful features such as monthly sales.
- **Modular Coding**: Writing reusable functions for transformation tasks.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data pipeline steps.
- `agg_data.csv`: A CSV file with aggregated data used in the project.
- `clean_data.csv`: A CSV file containing the cleaned dataset.
- `extra_data.parquet`: A Parquet file with additional data for analysis.
- `walmartecomm.jpg`: An image related to the project.

## About

This project was developed as part of a DataCamp course and showcases my ability to manage and transform large datasets, providing a foundation for advanced analytics.
